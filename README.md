# Stadskompassen

**Stadskompassen** is a reflective, educational game that explores how people
prioritize values when societal decisions require compromise.

There are no right or wrong answers.
The outcome is a **decision profile** designed to support discussion,
comparison, and reflection on democracy, responsibility, and leadership.

## What Is Stadskompassen?

Stadskompassen is:
- a reflection tool
- a discussion starter
- a model of value conflicts and compromise

Stadskompassen is **not**:
- a test
- a party alignment quiz
- a judgment of the individual

---

## How Does the Game Work?

- Players face everyday societal dilemmas (education, safety, climate, etc.)
- Each option includes both gains and costs
- Each choice activates multiple values simultaneously
- Feedback is presented as lived, everyday consequences

After completing the game, players receive a **character profile**
showing which values they tend to prioritize.

## Characters

They represent value orientations inspired by:

Examples:
- The Enforcer – order and clarity
- The Caretaker – care and safety
- The Reflector – empathy and perspective
- The Trickster – critical questioning and humor
